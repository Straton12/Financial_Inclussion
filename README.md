> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd apps/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br /> 

## Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) execution
---
